# Content Analytics

Retrieve analytics for logged posts and provide data-driven improvement recommendations.

## Quick Commands

- "Check my YouTube analytics" - Get recent YouTube video performance
- "How did my last post do?" - Analyze most recent post
- "Compare my posts" - Side-by-side performance comparison
- "What's working?" - Identify top-performing content patterns

## Workflow

### Step 1: List Logged Posts

Query recent posts from cf_content_posts_log (if connected to Supabase) or use Zernio MCP:

```
Use mcp__zernio__posts_list with:
- status: "published"
- limit: 10
```

### Step 2: Fetch Analytics

**For All Platforms:**
```
Use mcp__zernio__analytics_get_analytics with:
- platform: "youtube" (or linkedin, instagram, twitter, etc.)
- limit: 50
- sort_by: "date"
- order: "desc"
```

**For Specific Post:**
```
Use mcp__zernio__analytics_get_analytics with:
- post_id: "LATE_POST_ID"
```

**For YouTube Daily Breakdown:**
```
Use mcp__zernio__analytics_get_you_tube_daily_views with:
- video_id: "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID"
- account_id: "LATE_ACCOUNT_ID"
- start_date: "YYYY-MM-DD" (optional, defaults to 30 days ago)
```

**For LinkedIn Aggregate:**
```
Use mcp__zernio__analytics_get_linked_in_aggregate_analytics with:
- account_id: "LATE_ACCOUNT_ID"
- aggregation: "TOTAL" or "DAILY"
- metrics: "IMPRESSION,REACTION,COMMENT,RESHARE"
```

**For Follower Growth:**
```
Use mcp__zernio__accounts_get_follower_stats with:
- from_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
- to_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
- granularity: "daily"
```

### Step 3: Analyze Performance

Compare metrics against benchmarks:

| Metric | Good | Great | Excellent |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| YouTube CTR | 4-6% | 6-10% | 10%+ |
| YouTube Retention | 40% | 50% | 60%+ |
| LinkedIn Engagement | 2% | 5% | 10%+ |
| Instagram Engagement | 3% | 6% | 10%+ |

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations

Based on data patterns, suggest:
- **Title improvements** - If CTR is low
- **Thumbnail changes** - If impressions high but clicks low
- **Content structure** - If retention drops early
- **Posting time** - Based on engagement patterns
- **Hashtag optimization** - If reach is limited
