# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## Heartbeat

Before doing anything else in any session:
1. Read `context/SOUL.md` — who you are, how you behave
2. Read `context/USER.md` — who you're helping and their preferences
3. Read `context/MEMORY.md` — long-term business knowledge
4. Read `context/memory/{today}.md` + `context/memory/{yesterday}.md` — recent session context
5. **Create or open today's memory file** — if `context/memory/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` doesn't exist, create it with a session start timestamp. If it already exists (second session today), append a new session header. See **Daily Memory** below.
6. Scan `brand_context/` — what exists? Flag anything older than 30 days: "Your [file] is from [date]. Want to refresh, or keep going?"
7. Scan `.claude/skills/` — know what skills are installed and available
8. **Sync check** — run the skill & MCP reconciliation (see below)

### Daily Memory

Every session writes to `context/memory/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`. This is how continuity works across sessions.

**One file per day**, with numbered session blocks (`## Session 1`, `## Session 2`, etc.).

**At session start:** Create the file if it doesn't exist, or append a new session block if it does:
```
## Session N

### Goal
[Filled once the user states their goal]
```

**During the session:** Update the current session block with key events as they happen:
- Deliverables produced (with file paths)
- Decisions made
- Feedback received
- Anything the next session should know

**At session end (via /wrap-up):** The wrap-up skill finalises the session block — replacing any placeholder text with real content. Even without `/wrap-up`, the file should have useful context because it was written incrementally.

Keep entries concise — bullet points, not paragraphs. This file is read at the start of every future session.

### Skill & MCP Reconciliation

Compare what's on disk against what's registered in this file. Fix any drift silently for additions; confirm with the user for removals.

**Skills — compare `.claude/skills/` folders vs the Skill Registry and Context Matrix tables above:**

1. **New skill on disk, not in CLAUDE.md?** → Read its YAML frontmatter and full SKILL.md, then:
   - Add a row to the **Skill Registry** table (under the correct category heading)
   - Add a row to the **Context Matrix** table (read `## Context Needs` from its SKILL.md)
   - Add a `## {folder-name}` section to `context/learnings.md` under `# Individual Skills`
   - Add the skill to the **README.md** skill tables and file structure diagram
   - **Scan for external service dependencies** (see below)
   - Tell the user: "Registered `{skill-name}` — added to CLAUDE.md Skill Registry, Context Matrix, README.md, and context/learnings.md."

2. **Skill in CLAUDE.md but folder missing from disk?** → Ask the user: "`{skill-name}` is in the CLAUDE.md Skill Registry but the folder is gone. Remove it from CLAUDE.md Skill Registry, Context Matrix, README.md, and context/learnings.md?"

**MCPs — compare `.claude/settings.json` MCP server entries vs a tracked list:**

3. **New MCP server in settings.json, not documented?** → Add it to the README.md under a Connected Tools section (create the section if it doesn't exist). Tell the user what was added.

4. **Documented MCP removed from settings.json?** → Ask the user: "`{mcp-name}` is documented but no longer in settings.json. Remove from README.md?"

**External service detection — runs as part of step 1 above (new skill registration):**

5. **Scan the new skill's SKILL.md and references/ for external API dependencies.** Look for:
   - Environment variable references (e.g. `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, any `*_API_KEY` or `*_SECRET` pattern)
   - API endpoint URLs (e.g. `api.firecrawl.dev`, `api.openai.com`)
   - SDK imports (e.g. `from firecrawl import`, `import openai`)
   - Explicit mentions of requiring API keys or external services

6. **For each external service found**, check if it's already documented:
   - **Not in CLAUDE.md Service Registry?** → Add a row to the **External Services & API Keys → Service Registry** table with: service name, key name, which skills use it, what it enables, fallback without it
   - **Not in `.env.example`?** → Add the key with a comment explaining the service, signup URL if found, and which skill uses it
   - **Not in README.md External Services table?** → Add a row
   - Tell the user: "Found external dependency: `{service}` (`{KEY_NAME}`). Added to Service Registry, `.env.example`, and README. Add your key to `.env` when ready — the skill works without it using [fallback]."

7. **If a skill is removed** and was the last skill using a particular service → ask the user: "`{service}` is no longer used by any skill. Remove from Service Registry, `.env.example`, and README?"

### Task Routing

When the user asks a question or requests a task:
1. **Search installed skills first.** Check `.claude/skills/` frontmatter for a matching skill.
2. **Skill found** → invoke it. Always prefer the dedicated skill over base knowledge.
3. **No matching skill** → inform the user explicitly and offer the choice:
   - **(a) Find or build a skill** — search for an existing skill to install, or build one with `meta-skill-creator`, so the system handles this task well every time
   - **(b) Handle it now with base knowledge** — complete the task without a skill, understanding output won't benefit from a tested methodology or the learnings loop

Never silently fall back to base knowledge when a skill exists. Never silently handle a task without telling the user a skill gap was found.

### Before Major Deliverables
- Is the relevant brand_context file loaded per the context matrix below?
- Are there learnings in `context/learnings.md` for this skill's section?
- If brand_context is missing, offer to run `/start-here` — never block work because context is missing

### After Major Deliverables
- Ask: "How did this land? Any adjustments?"
- Log feedback to `context/learnings.md` under the skill's section
- If gaps were spotted, mention once with opportunity framing: "I can make this more targeted once we build your ICP profile — want to do that now or after?"

## What This Project Is

Agentic OS is a Claude Code project template that turns any client folder into an intelligent business assistant. It is **agent-first**: personality lives in context/SOUL.md, long-term knowledge lives in context/MEMORY.md, brand memory lives in `brand_context/`, and functionality lives in `.claude/skills/`.

**One command to start: `/start-here`**. Everything else is a skill that triggers automatically or gets invoked by the orchestrator.

The full specification lives in `PRD.md`. Read it when building any new component.

---

## Three-Layer Architecture

| Layer | Files | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Agent Identity** | CLAUDE.md, `context/SOUL.md`, `context/USER.md`, `context/MEMORY.md` | Who the agent is and how it behaves |
| **Skills Pack** | `.claude/skills/{category}-{skill-name}/` | Capabilities. Grows over time. |
| **Brand Context** | `brand_context/` | Client brand data. Version controlled. |

`.env` is the **only** gitignored file.

---

## Skill Categories

Every skill and its output folder uses a category prefix. This keeps skills, outputs, and learnings sections consistently named.

| Prefix | Domain | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `mkt` | Marketing | `mkt-brand-voice`, `mkt-positioning`, `mkt-icp`, `mkt-email-sequence` |
| `str` | Strategy | `str-keyword-plan`, `str-competitor-analysis` |
| `ops` | Operations / File Mgmt | `ops-client-onboarding`, `ops-gdrive-sync` |
| `viz` | Visual / Video | `viz-thumbnail-creator`, `viz-ugc-generator` |
| `acc` | Accounting | `acc-invoice-generator`, `acc-expense-tracker` |
| `meta` | System / Meta | `meta-skill-creator`, `meta-wrap-up` |
| `tool` | Utility / Integration | `tool-firecrawl-scraper` — backend tools used by other skills |

**Rules:**
- Skill folder name = `{category}-{skill-name}` in kebab-case
- YAML frontmatter `name` field must match the folder name exactly
- Output folders use the same category prefix: `projects/{category}-{output-type}/`
- Learnings sections in `context/learnings.md` use `## {folder-name}` (e.g., `## mkt-brand-voice`)
- Add new categories only when the first skill in a new domain is built

## Context Matrix

Which `brand_context/` files each skill reads. Load only what's listed — no skill gets more context than it needs.

| Skill | voice-profile | positioning | icp | samples | assets | learnings |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `mkt-brand-voice` | **writes** | summary | — | **writes** | **writes** (via firecrawl branding) | `## mkt-brand-voice` |
| `mkt-positioning` | — | **writes** | full | — | — | `## mkt-positioning` |
| `mkt-icp` | — | summary | **writes** | — | — | `## mkt-icp` |
| `meta-wrap-up` | — | — | — | — | — | `## meta-wrap-up` |
| `tool-firecrawl-scraper` | — | — | — | — | — | `## tool-firecrawl-scraper` |
| `str-trending-research` | — | — | language section | — | — | `## str-trending-research` |
| `mkt-content-repurposing` | full | — | — | yes | — | `## mkt-content-repurposing` |
| `mkt-copywriting` | full | angle only | full | yes | — | `## mkt-copywriting` |
| `tool-humanizer` | full | — | — | tone refs | — | `## tool-humanizer` |
| `tool-youtube` | — | — | — | — | — | `## tool-youtube` |
| `viz-excalidraw-diagram` | — | — | — | — | — | `## viz-excalidraw-diagram` |
| `viz-nano-banana` | — | — | — | — | — | `## viz-nano-banana` |
| `viz-ugc-heygen` | full | — | language section | tone refs | — | `## viz-ugc-heygen` |
| `mkt-ugc-scripts` | full | angle only | language section | tone refs | — | `## mkt-ugc-scripts` |
| `ops-cron` | — | — | — | — | — | `## ops-cron` |

*New skills declare their own row when added.*

**Matrix key:** `writes` = creates file | `full` = entire file | `summary` = 1-2 sentences | `angle only` = chosen angle | `tone only` = tone + vocabulary | `language section` = words-they-use section | `## skill-name` = read only that section from context/learnings.md | `—` = don't load

**Learnings rule:** Every skill reads and writes to its own section in `context/learnings.md`. Section headings match the skill's folder name exactly (e.g., `## mkt-brand-voice`). Cross-skill insights go under `# General` (`## What works well` / `## What doesn't work well`). Skill-specific entries go under `# Individual Skills` → `## {folder-name}`.

---

## Output Standards

- Save all generated content to `projects/{category}-{output-type}/`
- The category prefix in the output folder matches the skill's category (e.g., `mkt-brand-voice` skill → `projects/mkt-*/` outputs)
- Folder naming: `{category}-{output-type}` in kebab-case (e.g., `mkt-linkedin-carousel`, `str-keyword-plan`)
- Filename format: `{descriptive-name}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (folder provides context, no skill-name prefix needed)
- Folders are created on first use by the skill. No empty pre-scaffolding.
- Default format: markdown unless user specifies otherwise
- After major deliverables: ask for feedback, log to `context/learnings.md`

### Humanizer Gate

**Every skill that produces publishable text must run its output through `tool-humanizer` as a final step before saving.** This is not optional.

- Execution skills (copywriting, content repurposing, email sequences, blog posts, etc.) call the humanizer in pipeline mode after generating content
- The humanizer uses `deep` mode when `brand_context/voice-profile.md` exists, `standard` mode otherwise
- Only show the score summary to the user if the change was significant (delta > 2 points)
- Skills that produce non-publishable output (research briefs, ICP profiles, positioning docs, schemas) skip this step

When building new skills, include a humanizer step in the methodology if the skill writes content meant for an audience. Reference `tool-humanizer` in pipeline mode.

### Schemas (Two-Tier System)

Schemas live next to the data they validate. Two tiers:

| Tier | Location | Validates |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Brand context schemas | `brand_context/schemas/` | `brand_context/*.md` structured data blocks |
| Output schemas | `projects/{folder}/00-schemas/` | Output files in that project folder |

**Current brand context schemas:**

| Schema | Used by | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `brand_context/schemas/voice-profile.schema.json` | `mkt-brand-voice` | Structured voice data embedded in voice-profile.md |

*Output schemas are added inside each project folder's `00-schemas/` subfolder as execution skills are built. The `00-schemas/` subfolder is only created when a schema is relevant for that output type.*

When a skill produces structured output, it should read the relevant schema before generating data to ensure all required fields are present. Skills consuming structured output from another skill should also reference the schema to understand the data contract.

---

## Building New Skills

**Always ask for reference skills first.** Never guess at methodology — the user provides examples, Claude Code learns the pattern, then scaffolds. Use the `meta-skill-creator` skill to scaffold and iterate.

### Skill structure
```
.claude/skills/{category}-{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md          ← YAML frontmatter + methodology (~200 lines max)
├── references/       ← Depth material, one topic per file (~200-300 lines each)
├── scripts/          ← Executable scripts including setup.sh for auto-install (optional)
└── assets/           ← Example outputs, design references, templates (optional)
```

### Auto-Setup Convention

Skills that need external binaries (e.g. `uv`, `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`) must include a `scripts/setup.sh` that auto-detects and installs them. The SKILL.md should include a **Step 0: Auto-Setup** that runs this script before any other operation.

**Rules:**
- The setup script checks `command -v` first — never reinstall what already exists
- Uses `brew` on macOS if available, falls back to `curl`/`pip`/other package managers
- Reports clear success/failure per dependency
- Only runs once per machine — skip on subsequent calls if all binaries are present
- Never requires user interaction (no prompts, no sudo unless absolutely necessary)

### YAML frontmatter rules
- ~100 words, under 1024 characters
- Include trigger phrases AND negative triggers
- No XML angle brackets

### Skill Dependencies

Skills can depend on other skills. Declare dependencies in a `## Dependencies` section in SKILL.md so the system knows what's needed.

```markdown
## Dependencies

| Skill | Required? | What it provides | Without it |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| `tool-youtube` | Optional | YouTube transcript fetching | Ask user to paste content manually |
```

**Rules:**
- **Required** dependencies must be installed for the skill to function at all
- **Optional** dependencies enhance the skill but it works without them — always declare the fallback
- At session start, if a skill is invoked and a required dependency is missing, tell the user which skill to install
- Dependencies are one-way — utility (`tool-`) skills never depend on execution skills

### Registration checklist
- [ ] Folder name = `{category}-{skill-name}` matching the Skill Categories table
- [ ] `name` field in frontmatter matches the folder name exactly
- [ ] Add to skill registry table above
- [ ] Add row to context matrix above
- [ ] Frontmatter < 1024 chars
- [ ] SKILL.md < 200 lines
- [ ] References are self-contained
- [ ] If the skill depends on other skills: add a `## Dependencies` section to SKILL.md
- [ ] If the skill produces structured/repeatable output: create a schema in `brand_context/schemas/` (for brand context data) or `projects/{folder}/00-schemas/` (for output data) and reference it from SKILL.md
- [ ] Declare which `projects/` subfolder(s) the skill writes to (must use same category prefix)
- [ ] **External services**: If the skill uses any external API, ensure the key is in the Service Registry (CLAUDE.md), `.env.example`, and README.md External Services table. The reconciliation does this automatically, but verify it ran.
- [ ] **Humanizer gate**: If the skill produces publishable text (blog posts, social content, copy, emails), include a step that runs output through `tool-humanizer` in pipeline mode before saving

### Folder naming
- Format: `{category}-{skill-name}` in kebab-case (e.g., `mkt-brand-voice`, `ops-client-onboarding`)
- Cannot contain "claude" or "anthropic"

## Build Order (from PRD)

1. **Phase 1 — Agent Identity:** context/SOUL.md → context/USER.md → context/MEMORY.md ✓
2. **Phase 2 — Command + Foundation Skills:** `start-here.md` ✓ → `mkt-brand-voice/` ✓ → `mkt-positioning/` ✓ → `mkt-icp/` ✓
3. **Phase 3 — Validate:** End-to-end test with a real business
4. **Phase 4 — Execution Skills:** Build incrementally, each with reference skills
5. **Phase 5 — Expand:** First non-marketing skill proves architecture is domain-agnostic

---

## Graceful Degradation

Skills work at all context levels:
- **No brand_context/**: Standalone mode — ask what's needed, produce solid generic output
- **Partial**: Use what exists, default for the rest
- **Full**: Fully personalised

Brand context **enhances**. It never gates functionality.

---

## External Services & API Keys

Some skills use external services for enhanced functionality. API keys are stored in `.env` (gitignored). `.env.example` documents all available keys.

### Service Registry

| Service | API Key | Used by | What it enables | Without it |
|---------|---------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Firecrawl | `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | `tool-firecrawl-scraper`, `mkt-brand-voice` (Auto-Scrape) | JS-heavy site scraping, anti-bot bypass, brand asset extraction (logo, colors, fonts) | Falls back to WebFetch (free). If that also fails, asks user to paste content manually |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `str-trending-research` | Reddit search via Responses API with `web_search` tool — real upvotes, comments, top comment insights | Falls back to WebSearch (free, no engagement metrics) |
| xAI | `XAI_API_KEY` | `str-trending-research` | X/Twitter search via xAI API with `x_search` tool — real likes, reposts, reply counts | Falls back to WebSearch (free, no engagement metrics) |
| YouTube Data API v3 | `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | `tool-youtube` | Channel video listing, @handle resolution, search | Transcript mode still works with direct URLs (free via yt-dlp). Channel listing unavailable |
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `viz-nano-banana` | Image generation via Gemini 3 Pro Image | No fallback — image generation requires the API key. Free tier available |
| HeyGen | `HEYGEN_API_KEY` | `viz-ugc-heygen` | AI avatar video generation with cloned avatars and custom voices | No fallback — video generation requires the API key and HeyGen plan credits |

*Add new services to this table and to `.env.example` when skills are built that use them.*

### Rules for Skills Using External Services

1. **Check before using.** Before calling any external API, check `.env` for the required key. Never assume it's there.
2. **Tell the user what they're missing.** If the key is absent, explain clearly:
   - What the service does
   - What they'll miss without it
   - How to get a key (signup URL, free tier info)
   - Where to put it: "Add `KEY_NAME=your-key` to your `.env` file"
3. **Always have a fallback.** No skill should break because an API key is missing. Degrade gracefully — use free tools first, then prompt for the key only when the free path fails.
4. **Don't block work.** If the fallback produces usable (even if less rich) output, proceed and note what would improve with the API key.
5. **Update `.env.example`** when adding a new external service dependency.

---

## Permissions

`.claude/settings.json` allows: `cat`, `ls`, `npm run *`, basic git commands, edits to `/src/**`

Denied: package installs, `rm`/`curl`/`wget`/`ssh`, reading `.env`/`.env.local` or credential files. `.env.example` is readable and editable (it's a template, not secrets).
