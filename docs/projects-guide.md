# Working on Projects

Not everything is a single task. When you have a larger piece of work — a product launch, a content series, a website overhaul — you need a way to scope it, track it, and keep context across sessions.

There are three levels. When you tell Claude your goal, it helps you pick the right one.

---

## The Three Levels

| Level | Name | When | Where |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| **1** | Single task | One or a few small deliverables | `projects/{category}/` |
| **2** | Planned project | Multi-deliverable, cross-session — campaigns, launches | `projects/briefs/{project-name}/` |
| **3** | GSD project | Complex multi-phase with dependencies | `projects/briefs/{project-name}/` + `.planning/` |

**"Your working folder"** = the root `agentic-os/` folder for solo/system-wide work, or `clients/client-name/` for client-specific work. All paths are relative to wherever you `cd`'d.

---

## Level 1: Single Task

Just ask Claude. Output goes to `projects/{category}-{type}/`. No brief, no project folder. Use Shift+Tab twice for plan mode if upfront thinking helps.

```
projects/mkt-copywriting/2026-03-24_blog-post.md
```

---

## Level 2: Planned Project

For multi-deliverable work — campaigns, launches, client deliverables. Claude runs a short scoping conversation (goal, deliverables, acceptance criteria, timeline) and writes a `brief.md`.

The project gets its own folder under `projects/briefs/`. ALL outputs for that project go inside it — not scattered across category folders. Projects are listed most-recent-first (by `created` date in frontmatter) when reporting to the user.

```
projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/   <- project folder
├── brief.md                         <- scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria
├── 2026-03-24_landing-page.md       <- outputs live WITH the brief
├── 2026-03-25_email-sequence.md
└── 2026-03-22_competitor-scan.md
```

### What goes in the brief

Claude scopes the project by asking:
- What's the goal? (one sentence)
- What are the deliverables? (checklist)
- How will you know it's done? (acceptance criteria)
- Any timeline or constraints?

The brief is saved as `projects/briefs/{project-name}/brief.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
project: q2-product-launch
status: active
level: 2
created: 2026-03-24
---
```

---

## Level 3: GSD Project

For complex multi-phase work with dependencies and milestones.

GSD uses a `.planning/` folder to store its roadmap, phase plans, and verification reports. This folder lives at the root of whatever workspace you're in — so if you're working in `clients/client-one/`, it's `clients/client-one/.planning/`. If you're working from the root, it's `agentic-os/.planning/`.

Your project's outputs and brief still live in `projects/briefs/{project-name}/`. The `.planning/` folder is GSD's working space — it links back to your project.

```
projects/briefs/website-rebuild/     <- project folder (your stuff)
├── brief.md                         <- project brief (links to .planning/)
├── 2026-03-24_homepage-copy.md      <- outputs still go in the project folder
└── 2026-03-25_sitemap.excalidraw

.planning/                           <- GSD working space (at workspace root)
├── PROJECT.md
├── ROADMAP.md
├── STATE.md
├── config.json
├── research/
├── intel/
└── phases/
    ├── 01-foundation/
    │   ├── PLAN.md
    │   └── VERIFICATION.md
    └── 02-build/
```

### One GSD project at a time

Each workspace (root or client folder) can run one GSD project at a time, because `.planning/` is shared. This means:

- **Solo user:** one GSD project at a time in your root folder
- **Multi-client:** each client can have its own GSD project running simultaneously (they each have their own `.planning/`)
- **Need two GSD projects for the same client?** Finish one first, or use separate client workspaces

If you try to start a new GSD project while one is already active, Claude will offer to archive the existing one first.

### Archiving a completed GSD project

When you're done with a GSD project, run `/archive-gsd`. This:

1. Moves `.planning/` into your project folder as `planning-archive/`
2. Updates the brief's status to `complete`
3. Shows you where everything was moved
4. Frees up the workspace for a new GSD project

The archive preserves the full roadmap, phase plans, and verification reports alongside your project's outputs and brief — so you can always go back and see how the project was planned and executed.

```
projects/briefs/website-rebuild/     <- after archiving
├── brief.md                         <- status: complete
├── 2026-03-24_homepage-copy.md
├── 2026-03-25_sitemap.excalidraw
└── planning-archive/                <- moved from .planning/
    ├── PROJECT.md
    ├── ROADMAP.md
    └── phases/
```

## How It All Fits Together

```
projects/
├── mkt-copywriting/                <- single task category folder (Level 1)
│   └── 2026-03-20_blog-post.md
├── str-trending-research/          <- single task category folder
│   └── 2026-03-18_ai-trends.md
└── briefs/                         <- all Level 2/3 projects (most recent first)
    ├── kanban-dashboard/           <- Level 2 planned project (has brief.md)
    │   ├── brief.md
    │   └── 2026-03-24_architecture.md
    ├── q2-product-launch/          <- Level 2 planned project
    │   ├── brief.md
    │   ├── 2026-03-24_landing-page.md
    │   ├── 2026-03-25_email-sequence.md
    │   └── 2026-03-22_competitor-scan.md
    └── website-rebuild/            <- Level 3 GSD project (has brief.md, links to .planning/)
        ├── brief.md
        ├── 2026-03-24_homepage-copy.md
        └── 2026-03-25_sitemap.excalidraw

.planning/                          <- GSD only (Level 3), at project root — one at a time
├── PROJECT.md
├── ROADMAP.md
└── phases/
```

**How to tell them apart:**
- Category folders live directly under `projects/` using `{category}-{type}` naming (e.g., `mkt-copywriting`) — no `brief.md` inside
- Project folders live under `projects/briefs/` with descriptive names (e.g., `kanban-dashboard`) — always have a `brief.md` inside
- When listing projects, most recent first (by `created` date in frontmatter)

The heartbeat scans for `brief.md` files inside `projects/briefs/*/` to find active projects.

---

## Session Memory and Projects

When you're working on a Level 2 or 3 project, each session's memory block (`context/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) includes a `### Project` field that links back to the project name. This means when Claude starts your next session and reads yesterday's memory, it automatically loads the project's `brief.md` for full context — you don't need to re-explain what you're working on.

For single tasks (Level 1), the project field is omitted and sessions work as before.

---

## Working Directory Matters

Be explicit about WHERE you work:

**Solo user or shared work:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/agentic-os
claude
# "Start a project for Q2 product launch"
# -> Creates projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/brief.md
# -> All outputs go to projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/
```

**Client-specific projects:**
```bash
cd ~/Projects/agentic-os/clients/client-one
claude
# "Start a project for Q2 product launch"
# -> Creates projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/brief.md (inside client-one/)
# -> All outputs go to clients/client-one/projects/briefs/q2-product-launch/
```

The paths are always relative to your working directory. If you're in the wrong folder, outputs go to the wrong place. The heartbeat confirms which workspace you're in.

All three levels coexist. You might use Level 1 for daily requests, Level 2 for a campaign, and Level 3 for a website rebuild — all within the same workspace.
